# 4th Year Research project on kenya's Covid19 Data Analysis
### INTRODUCTION
While the number of confirmed cases worldwide and in Kenya is reported daily, detailed data on the outcomes of people who test positive for COVID-19 such as the male to female infection ratio, recovery to death ratio, infection rate, mortality rate and predictors of outcomes, are still scarce. COVID-19 data analysis and visualization carry much importance as even the smallest analyzation can be of great help in the current situation that the world and our country Kenya is facing. This is the aim of this research project – to visualize and analyze COVID-19 data on Kenya’s population.

#### General Objective:
The main objective of this study is to analyze and visualize Covid19 data on Kenya’s population.

#### Specific Objective
* To analyze the male to female infection ratio
* To analyze the recovery to death ratio
* To identify the areas with high Covid cases
* To calculate the Infection rate and mortality rate

### RESULTS
Using the cleaned data, it was possible to answer some of the questions related to the sex distribution, recovery to death ratio, infection, mortality and recovery rates. I found the following insights during the analysis: The ratio of male to female infections showed that for every male infected, 2 females tested positive. The recovery to death ratio showed that for every 47 recoveries, 1 person lost their life. The mortality rate showed a 2% chance of death for every positive case. The recovery rate showed a 86% chance of recovery for a positive case. The infection rate in a given sample size showed 87 positive cases for every 1000 people tested.
